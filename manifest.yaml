  short: A Monero Full Node
  long: Monero is a private, secure, untraceable, decentralised digital currency. You are your bank, you control your funds, and nobody can trace your transfers unless you allow them to do so.  This is a headless (no GUI) server, used via an external Monero wallet of your choice over Tor.

alerts:
  uninstall: Uninstalling Monero will result in permanent loss of data. Without a backup, any funds stored on your node's default hot wallet will be lost forever. If you are unsure, we recommend making a backup, just to be safe.
  restore: Restoring Monero will overwrite its current data. You will lose any transactions recorded in watch-only wallets, and any funds you have received to the hot wallet since the last backup.
