# Monero

To begin using Monero, simply hit "Configure," making changes if you wish, or using the provided defaults. Then click "Start." The Monero blockchain will begin to download. This can take 24 hours to a week, depending on your hardware and network connectivity. The size of the blockchain and indexes is approximately 190GB in mid 2024. You may choose to prune old blocks (enable in Monero -> Config) to save space. Once 100% synced, your Monero node is ready to use!

## Connecting a Wallet

You can connect a wallet by using the "RPC URL" string from the "Properties" section of the Monero service page. User/pass authentication is optional and configurable in Config > RPC Settings > RPC Credentials. Check out the [guides](https://github.com/kn0wmad/monerod-wrapper/tree/master/docs/guides.md) for tested wallets and detailed walk-throughs.
