# Monero
To begin using Monero, simply hit "Configure," making changes if you wish, or using the provided defaults.  Then click "Start."  The Monero blockchain will begin to download.  This will take up to 24 hours (on low-resource hardware like a Raspberry Pi).  The size of the blockchain and indexes is approximately 150GB in early 2023.  You may choose to prune old blocks (enable in Monero -> Config) to save space.  Once 100% synced, your Monero node is ready to use!

## Connecting a Wallet
You can connect a wallet by using the "RPC Connection" string from the "Interfaces" section of the Monero service page.  Check out the [guides]() for tested wallets and further instructions.
