# Monero
To begin using Monero, simply hit "Configure," making changes if you wish, or using the provided defaults.  Then click "Start."  The Monero blockchain will begin to download.  This can take 24-48+ hours depending on your hardware.  The size of the blockchain and indexes is approximately 150GB in early 2023.  You may choose to prune old blocks (enable in Monero -> Config) to save space.  Once 100% synced, your Monero node is ready to use!

## Connecting a Wallet
You can connect a wallet by using the "RPC Connection" string from the "Properties" section of the Monero service page.  User/pass authentication is not needed or currently supported.  Check out the [guides](https://github.com/kn0wmad/monerod-wrapper/tree/master/docs/guides.md) for tested wallets and detailed walk-throughs.

Welcome to Monero!
