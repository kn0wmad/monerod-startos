# Monero
To begin using Monero, simply hit "Configure," making changes if you wish, or using the provided defaults.  Then click "Start."  The Monero blockchain will begin to download.  This will take up to 24 hours (on a Raspberry Pi) as the size of the blockchain is approximately 100GB in late 2022.  Once 100% synced, your Monero node is ready to use!

## Connecting a Wallet
You can connect a wallet by using the "RPC Connection" string from the "Interfaces" section of the Monero service page.
