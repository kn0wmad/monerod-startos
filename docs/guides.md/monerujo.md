1. Download Monerujo from your app registry of choice (Aurora, F-Droid, Play Store), or directly from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/m2049r/xmrwallet/releases)
1. Open Monerujo and tap the globe image under "Network" in order to switch to Tor, then tap to the right of that (on either the exiting node or the loading text) to enter the node selection screen. Then tap the `+` in the bottom-right
1. Copy your RPC connection string (Tor) from your server's Monero page -> Interfaces and paste it into the `Hostname` field
   - Be sure that the format is `yourUniqueString.onion` (Tor)
1. Enter the port `18089`, (optionally) name your node, and (optionally) `TEST` the connection, then click `OK`
1. That's it, you're ready to use Monerujo Wallet with your own Monero node!
